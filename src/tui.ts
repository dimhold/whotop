/**
 * The interactive screen: scroll, search, kill.
 *
 * Split in two on purpose. Everything above `runTui` is pure and takes no
 * terminal, so the tests exercise the parts that decide what happens, the way
 * the collectors keep parsing apart from spawning. `runTui` is the thin part
 * that owns stdin, the alternate screen and the redraw loop.
 *
 * Two rules shape the whole file.
 *
 * The selection follows a pid, never a row number. A refresh reorders the list
 * whenever a process exits or a port moves, and a cursor anchored to row 7
 * would quietly come to rest on a different process than the one the person
 * was looking at. Killing that one is the exact mistake this tool was written
 * to prevent, so it must not be reintroduced by its own screen.
 *
 * The terminal is always restored. Raw mode, the alternate screen and a hidden
 * cursor are three global changes to somebody's shell, and a crash that leaves
 * them set hands back a session that appears broken.
